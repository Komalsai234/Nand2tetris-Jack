# Implementation of String Libraries in Jack

In this Project of implementing the string libraries in Jack, we implemented a different method in the String class for setting individual characters of the string, for erasing the string’s last character, for appending a character to string’s end etc.

 The methods of the string library are  
	
    1. setcharAt (sets the jth character of the string to given character ‘c’)
	2. appenLastchar (appends character ‘c’ to end of the string)
	3. eraseLastchar (erases the last character of the given string)
	4. intValue (returns integer value of string until first non-numeric character)
	5. toUppercase (converts all the characters of the string into upper cases)
	6. toLowercase (converts all the characters of the string into lower cases)
	7. startswith (checks whether the given string starts with given character)
	8. endswith (checks whether the given string ends with given character)
	9. count (returns no.of times given character appeared in given string)
	10. substring (return the substring of given string from start to (end-1))
	11.	compareTo (checks whether given two strings are equal or not)


For the implementation of the above mentioned method we will write a corresponding Jack code.
And this jack code is compiled to .vm file using the Jack Compiler available in the Nand2tetris softwrae suite.



    This process is done in the Command prompt as follows:




 The .vm file obtained from the above process is loaded in the VM Translator and run to get the 
 desired output.
